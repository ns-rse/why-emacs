# Why Emacs?

Slides written for a presentation to colleagues at work on why I use [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/).

## Slides

These slides are written in [Quarto](https://www.quarto.org) and uses the
[quarto-revealjs-clean](https://github.com/grantmcdermott/quarto-revealjs-clean/) theme. The slides are published to
[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) via a [GitHub Action](https://docs.github.com/en/actions). You can view them
at [Why Emacs?](https://ns-rse.githu.io/why_emacs).

If you want to create your own slides you can use the [template](https://github.com/ns-rse/quarto-revealjs-template)
which I've contributed to.
